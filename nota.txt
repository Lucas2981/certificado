pip freeze > requirements.txt #para crear el archivo
pip install -r requirements.txt #para instalar las librerias



This is how I did it in 2021:

Enter Ctrl+Shift+P in your vs code.

Locate your Virtual Environment:

Python: select interpreter > Enter interpreter path > Find

Once you locate your virtual env select your python version:

your-virtual-env > bin > python3.

Now in your project you will see .vscode directory created open settings.json inside of it and add:

"python.terminal.activateEnvironment": true

don't forget to add comma before to separate it with already present key value pair.

Now restart the terminal.

You should see your virtual environment activated automatically.
